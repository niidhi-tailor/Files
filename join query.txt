The query below gives article name for class='C' and project='category':
select a.article_nm from article_desc as a join wiki_project as b on a.article_nm=b.article_nm where a.class='C' and b.project='category'; 

The query below gives three values article name, class and project:
select a.article_nm,a.class,b.project from article_desc as a join wiki_project as b on a.article_nm=b.article_nm where a.class='C' and b.project='category';

I also performed a query succesfully:
select a.article_nm,a.class,b.project from article_desc as a join wiki_project as b on a.article_nm=b.article_nm where a.class='C' and b.project='history';
